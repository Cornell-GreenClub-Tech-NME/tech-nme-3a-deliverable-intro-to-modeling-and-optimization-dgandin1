        "Response: I am currently working on attempting to quantify the amount of compost Cornell generates and its environmental impact, eventually proposing solutions on how Cornell could improve its composting efforts. Linear programming could be very relevent to the improvement stage, as we could do something very similar to this project. By attempting to quantify the financial cost and/or environmental benefits of compsting, we could use linear programming to model the ideal way Cornell could compsting as well as quantifying the cost and benefits. This would give us a straightfoward way to come up with ideal solutions that may not be obvious. Overall, linear programming can be very helpful for finding the optimal path to take when there is a constraint you must follow. There are numerous aspects of this that I could utilize in GreenClub and in my future carrear. "
